        <description>
            The host and port that the HBase master runs at. A value of
            'local' runs the master and a regionserver in a single
            process.

        <description>
            Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum. For
            example,
            "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
            By default this is set to localhost for local and
            pseudo-distributed modes of operation. For a
            fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full list
            of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in
            hbase-env.sh this is the list of servers which we will
            start/stop ZooKeeper on.

        <description>
            Specifies the combined maximum allowed size of a KeyValue
            instance. This is to set an upper boundary for a single
            entry saved in a storage file. Since they cannot be split
            it helps avoiding that a region cannot be split any
            further because the data is too large. It seems wise to
            set this to a fraction of the maximum region size. Setting
            it to zero or less disables the check.
