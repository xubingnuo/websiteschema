<configuration>
    <property>
        <name>hbase.master</name>
        <value>${hbase.master}:60000</value>
        <description>
            The host and port that the HBase master runs at. A value of
            'local' runs the master and a regionserver in a single
            process.

    <property>
        <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
        <value>${hbase.zookeeper.quorum}</value>
        <description>
            Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum. For
            example,
            "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
            By default this is set to localhost for local and
            pseudo-distributed modes of operation. For a
            fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full list
            of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in
            hbase-env.sh this is the list of servers which we will
            start/stop ZooKeeper on.
